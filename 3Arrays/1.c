    // 1. Program to implement CHECKSUM (Input: sent_message = “10101111”, rec_message = “10101101”, block_size = 8
    // Output: Error (Since the 7th bit in the sent_message and the rec_message is different, the final checksum value is not equal to zero denoting that some error has occurred during transmission.)
    // Input: sent_message = “10000101011000111001010011101101”, rec_message = “10000101011000111001010011101101”, block_size = 8
    // Output: No Error)
